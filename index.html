<p class="box1">Due to constraints on foreign investment in communist Yugoslavia, the hotel was owned by the Rijeka-based Brodokomerc 'company'. During the Yugoslav Wars the hotel became a shelter for refugees. In 1995, the hotel was privatized and went through a number of owners. It hosted its last guests in 2001.</p>
<p class="box2">In October 2018, it was announced that an investor had plans to redevelop the venue into a closed resort with outside investment. [5] However, this would also entail closing off beach access to the public and would interrupt the continuous beach promenade between Malinska and Njivice. The City of Malinska, state administration, and locals oppose this request.[6].</p>
<p class="box3">The Haludovo Palace Hotel is an abandoned resort hotel on the Croatian island Krk north of Malinska. The hotel is named after a nearby beach.</p>
